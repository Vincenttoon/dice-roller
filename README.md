## Things Learned

- Usage of `useRef`: used to create mutable object properties that persist across renders. It is often used to hold references to DOM elements or to store mutable values that don't trigger a re-render when they change.

- Reintroduced usage of `timeout`, based of dice animations
- Further understand of `transform`, `breakpoints`, and `mixin` in SaSS & Css
- Further understanding of `useEffect` and `useState`
- Further practice with `Math.` functionality
- More practice and implementation of `SaSS`
- Image manipulation
